Diagramsm...nb includes diagrams of the given sector (csqrd=quadratic tidal effects). The notebook is to calculate these diagrams in terms of MI's.

IBP...nb is for IBP reduction of integrals of given sector.

In Folder sectorresults we insert MI's in the notebooks sector...nb and add all sectors in result.nb where final result is given.
